# For physics topics, use the specific subtopics, e.g. "Astrophysics"
topic: "Computer Science"
# An empty list here will include all categories in a topic
# Use the natural language names of the topics, found here: https://arxiv.org
# Including more categories will result in more calls to the large language model
categories: ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"]

# A natural language statement that the large language model will use to judge which papers are relevant

# For example:
#     "I am interested in complexity theory papers that establish upper bounds"

#     "making lots of money"
